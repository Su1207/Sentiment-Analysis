# Sentiment-Analysis

To analyze whether the products of the companies are good or not or whether the
companies get successful or not. One of the key attributes of this is by analyzing
customer reviews on the products and the companies, basically their sentiments. This
is where Sentiment Analysis comes into the picture. In this project, we will use
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and ML libraries for sentiment analysis in
python. It will basically show you the score of your textual data or paragraph data
and depending on that, will show you the emotion whether it is positive, negative or
neutral.
For example, “It is a quite boring movie…….. But the scenes were good enough.”
This sentence contains mixed emotions negative and positive but the overall
sentiment of the sentence will be positive.
